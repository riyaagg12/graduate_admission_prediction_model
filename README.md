## Introduction

Graduate admission prediction is crucial for students applying to universities. By analyzing historical data, this model helps identify the chances of admission, enabling better decision-making for applicants.

The project is implemented in Python using libraries such as:

- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project includes the following features:

- GRE Score
- TOEFL Score
- University Rating
- SOP (Statement of Purpose Strength)
- LOR (Letter of Recommendation Strength)
- CGPA (Cumulative Grade Point Average)
- Research Experience

The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, normalize the data, and prepare it for modeling.

## Installation

1. Open the project in Google Colab:

   - Upload the notebook file (`graduate_admission_prediction.ipynb`) to your Google Drive.
   - Open it in Google Colab by right-clicking the file and selecting "Open with > Google Colaboratory."

2. Ensure that the required libraries are installed in the Colab environment. Run the following command in a code cell to install missing dependencies:

   ```python
   !pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Open the notebook in Google Colab.
2. Run all cells to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.
3. Modify input values in the notebook to predict admission probabilities for custom data points.

## Results

The model achieved the following performance metrics:

- **Accuracy**: XX% (Replace with actual accuracy)
- **Mean Squared Error**: XX (Replace with actual MSE)

Visualization examples include:

- Feature importance
- Model accuracy vs. training epochs
